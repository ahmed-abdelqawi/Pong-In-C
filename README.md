# Pong In C

- **Pong** is a 1972 game published and developed by **Atari, inc**. This is a recreation of the game using `C23` as the main programming language and **Raylib** as the graphics API. I made this game to be close to the original as possible.

# How to run it!

- First you will need a `C` compiler - personally I use `gcc` - then you will need to install [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) and then run the commands below.

``` bash
# Clone the repo.
git clone https://github.com/ahmed-abdelqawi/Pong-In-C
# Move to the directory
cd Pong-In-C
# Build the game.
make release
# Run the game.
./pong
```

- This game was created by Ahmed Abdelqawi aka Fishy as my first game using raylib.
